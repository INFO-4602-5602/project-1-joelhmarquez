Project 1

** NOTE: I finished the project on time as you can see by the commit timestamps, and all the code is also in the "index.html" file outside this directory with the last commit dating to two days ago. However, I just realized that when I did my final commit, I forgot to "git add" the submission folder which has all the code condensed into this directory. I apologize about this late commit, it is only to push the submission folder up."

Part 1: Interpreting Data

Part 2: Building Scatterplots
In order to calculate the domains of the x and y axis, I manipulated the data to convert the x and y from strings to floats

Part 3: Building Line Graphs
For this part, I sorted the data based on the x value so the line wouldn't be all over the place.
I referenced: http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/arraysort2.shtml for the sorting comparison function
I also referenced https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3883245 to learn to draw a line graph using d3

Part 4: Interaction
Quicknote: It looks like the scatterplot and scatterLabel tags where in the location of part 3 (linegraph) so I moved them back to part 2 (scatterplot) since it seems that's where the interaction for this part wants to happen

Part 5: Building Multiple Charts
